Project Description:
In the thrilling plane-fighting game Aero Fighters, users take control of fighter aircraft and engage in fierce aerial combat against an artificial intelligence opponent. To keep players on their toes, the game has features like care packages, challenging terrain and a variety of shooting techniques. This game will be based on the Wings.io game, a .io game, but it will have a different set of features and entertaining interactive gameplay.

How to run the project:
Download the zip file and run main.py. The images are stored in the 'images' folder, and the rest of the .py files are in the same zip file.
To play the game, just move your mouse around to move your player's plane, and press the spacebar to fire any weapons!
